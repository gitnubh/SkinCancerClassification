# SkinCancerClassification
A web application that uses machine learning to identify skin cancer using Flask and Tensorflow.js create a web application that allows user input as an image file to check for it's malignance.


> Go to Kaggle and create an account.
> Copy and run the model from this link https://www.kaggle.com/code/nandakorey/skin-cancer-classification-completed-model
> pip install the following dependencies from requirements.txt
> Create a Flask server and route the html pages correctly, use the templates folder for reference.
> The styling and javascript files is in static folder.
> Correct the paths of the files and image names.

Note: The model isn't accurate because of the limitations of the dataset as it is unbalanced(out of 40,000 images only around 500 are malignant), so it classifies everything as benign. It isn't a practical model right now but a proof of concept that machine learning has immense potential as a dermatology assistant. 

Purpose
```````
Using a machine learning model on a webapp cuts down on time required to diagnose a patient with skin cancer(in this case), and thus increasing the chances of their survival since early stage detection directly correlates to survival rate of the patient. This also allows people in remote areas to access the model and elderly people to get an opinion before heading out which can be cumbersome.

> If everything works correctly it should look something like this.
