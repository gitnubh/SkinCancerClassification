      <p class="lead">Typically, the body’s skin cells grow old or become damaged over time, and normal cells grow and divide to form new, healthy cells to take their place. Sometimes, however, something goes wrong during this process, and new cells might be created when the body doesn’t need them, or old cells may not die as they should. When there’s a buildup of extra cells – old or new – they can form a malignant growth, or skin cancer.The skin is the body’s largest organ. Skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the epidermis (upper or outer layer) and the dermis (lower or inner layer). Skin cancer begins in the epidermis, which is made up of three kinds of cells—
        Basal and squamous cell carcinomas are the two most common types of skin cancer. They begin in the basal and squamous layers of the skin, respectively. Both can usually be cured, but they can be disfiguring and expensive to treat.
        Melanoma, the third most common type of skin cancer, begins in the melanocytes. Of all types of skin cancer, melanoma causes the most deaths because of its tendency to spread to other parts of the body, including vital organs.

              <strong>Basal-cell carcinoma (BCC), also known as basal-cell cancer, is the most common type of skin cancer.</strong> Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that begins in the basal cells. Normal basal cells line the epidermis. They’re the skin cells that replace old cells with new ones. Cancer of the basal cells results in tumors that appear on the skin’s surface. These tumors often look like sores, growths, bumps, scars, or red patches.
                  While BCC almost never spreads to other places in the body (metastasizes), it can still result in disfigurement. In rare cases, it can spread to other parts of the body. If it does, it can become life-threatening.<br><a class="accordion-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal-cell_carcinoma">Read More about Basal Cell Carcinoma Here</a><br><img class="accordion-images" src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/basal-cell-carcinoma.png')}}" alt="Basal Cell Carcinoma">

              <strong> Squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC),</strong> is a type of cancer. It develops in squamous cells, which are the thin, flat cells that make up the outermost layer of your skin. Squamous cells are also found in other parts of your body such as your lungs, mucous membranes, digestive tract, and urinary tract.
                      SCC that forms in your skin is known as cutaneous SCC (cSCC). cSCC develops due to changes in the DNA of squamous cells, which causes them to multiply uncontrollably. It often forms on parts of your skin frequently exposed to sunlight like your face, neck, or arms.<br><a class="accordion-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal-cell_carcinoma">Read More about Squamous Cell Carcinoma Here</a><br><img class="accordion-images" src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/squamous-cell-carcinoma.jpg')}}" alt="Squamous Cell Carcinoma">

              <strong>Melanoma, also redundantly known as malignant melanoma,</strong> is a type of skin cancer that develops from the pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye (uveal melanoma). In women, they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men, they most commonly occur on the back. About 25% of melanomas develop from moles. Changes in a mole that can indicate melanoma include an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown. <br> <a class="accordion-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal-cell_carcinoma">Read More about Melanoma Here</a><br><img class="accordion-images" src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/Melanoma.jpg')}}" alt="Melanoma">
